# Want to hire me? Want to grow your community?

I am available for consulting projects and ad-hoc advisory.
While I continue to work part-time,
my contract permits independent consulting opportunities
in the areas of open-source communities, CI/CD and developer tools, sustainability and green tech.
If you're looking for guidance and expertise in these areas, I'd love to connect and explore the opportunities. Let's build something great together!

If you are interested,
[let's have a virtual coffee ☕](https://calendly.com/onenashev/virtual-coffee).
You can also find my contacts [here](../contacts.md).

    The client states that Mr. Nenashev has played a pivotal role in fostering open-source collaboration and community growth;

    vibrant social media presence, organized events,
    and onboarded many 3rd-party projects to the main GitHub organization.

## How Can I Help?

With 15+ years of experience in developer tools and automation projects, and wearing many hats like CNCF Ambassador, Jenkins maintainer or Testcontainers Champion, now I focus on community building, all kinds of project automation, developer relations and advocacy across multiple areas and technology stacks.

In my consulting work, I want to prioritize projects of social importance, like green tech, sustainability, efficient developer tools, or companies that #StandWithUkraine. Pro-bono consulting for nonprofits and foundations is possible, too.

My consulting areas include but not limited to:

- Advisory roles for building and growing open source communities and ecosystems, in particular community management, developer relations and advocacy
- Automation, CI/CD and automation tools in Java, Golang, C/C++ and .NET technology stacks. It is not just about developer tools, I’m experienced with cloud native projects, automotive and embedded systems. I prefer GitHub Actions, Jenkins or Dagger, but have experience with other systems too
- Observability and developer productivity, especially in the areas of CI/CD and build tools.  I got some experience with OpenTelemetry, developer portals, and (too?) many cloud native tools
- Custom feature, integrations and fixes for the open source projects which I maintain or contribute to: Jenkins, Jenkinsfile Runner, Testcontainers, OpenFeature, WireMock, Microcks, WinSW, and many others
- Technical documentation at scale, documentation engines and customization for them, especially AsciiDocs, MkDocs, Hugo or Jekyll

It is also interesting to help enterprises to transform by
starting DevRel programs,
switching from classic marketing to product-led growth strategies,
or adopting [InnerSource](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inner_source) in your companies.
Hence I would be interested in joining
research divisions, OSPOs, or CTO offices as an advisor.

## My Availability

At the moment, I am looking for part-time consulting projects,
with up to several hours per week.
I can also take on short intense projects during my time in lieu time-offs.

## Pro Bono Consulting

If you are from an open source community or a non-profit organization and looking for help or advice,
feel free to reach out!
My time is limited, but I will see whether I can help.
Company and client non-competition agreements may apply.
