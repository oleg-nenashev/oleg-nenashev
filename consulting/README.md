  Consulting and advisory in open source communities, developer tools and automation, and DevRel.
  15+ years of experience. Pro-bono for nonprofits.

With 15+ years of experience in developer tools and automation projects, and wearing many hats like CNCF Ambassador, Jenkins maintainer or Testcontainers Champion, 
now I focus on community building, automation and developer productivity, across multiple areas and technology stacks.
I provide consulting and advisory in the same domains.
If you're looking for guidance and expertise in these areas, I'd love to connect and explore the opportunities. Let's build something great together!

!!! quote "Testimonial - Software Developer Advocate Consultant at WireMock Inc."

    During his assignment Mr. Nenashev... quadrupled community GitHub contributions to WireMock in 9 months...

    The client states that Mr. Nenashev has played a pivotal role in fostering open-source collaboration and community growth;
    his initiatives extended beyond mere developer advocacy and code contributions.
    Mr. Nenashev established the community governance framework, communication channels, and
    vibrant social media presence, organized events,
    and onboarded many 3rd-party projects to the main GitHub organization.
    His efforts helped to expand the WireMock ecosystem, particularly in the Golang and Python technology stacks

## Consulting Areas

My consulting areas include but not limited to:

Apart from community building, I can help with many other areas of Developer Relations,
including fractional Developer Advocate positions.

  I prefer GitHub Actions, Jenkins, Argo CD or Dagger, but have experience with other systems too.
- Observability and Developer Productivity, especially in the areas of CI/CD and build tools.
  I have experience with OpenTelemetry, developer portals, and (too?) many cloud native tools.

for software, hardware and embedded projects.
As a Jenkins core maintainer and a former governing board member,
I have experience with many areas of the ecosystem.

  especially for hardware and embedded projects
- Developing new plugins for Jenkins, and patching/refreshing the existing ones
- Internal trainings and workshops about Jenkins
- All kinds of integrations between Jenkins and other tools

## Pro Bono Consulting

In my consulting work, I want to prioritize projects of social importance, like green tech, sustainability, efficient developer tools, or companies that `#StandWithUkraine`. 
Pro-bono consulting for nonprofits and foundations is possible, too.

If you are from an open source community or a non-profit organization and looking for help or advice,
I am available to do pro-bono consulting, subject to availabiltiy.
