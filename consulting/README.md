# Want to hire me? Want to grow your community?

I am available for consulting projects and ad-hoc advisory.
While I continue to [work part-time](../work/README.md),
my contract allows independent consulting opportunities
in the areas of open-source communities, CI/CD and other areas.

## My Availability

I am ready to discuss consulting opportunities within the area of my interests:
open source community management,
developer relations (DevRel),
developer tools and productivity,
CI/CD,
observability,
embedded or cloud native systems,
and sustainability.

It is also interesting to help enterprises to transform by
starting DevRel programs,
switching from classic marketing to product-led growth strategies,
or adopting [InnerSource](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inner_source).
Hence I would be interested in joining
research divisions, OSPOs, or CTO offices as an advisor.

## Pro Bono Consulting

If you are from an open source community and looking for help or advice,
feel free to reach out!
Let's grab a [virtual coffee](https://calendly.com/onenashev/virtual-coffee).
My time is limited, but I will see whether I can help.
Company and client non-competition agreements may apply.
