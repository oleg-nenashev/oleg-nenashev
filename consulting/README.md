# Want to hire me? Want to grow your community?

I am available for consulting projects and ad-hoc advisory.
While I continue to work part-time,
my contract permits independent consulting opportunities
in the areas of open-source communities, CI/CD and developer tools, sustainability and green tech.
If you're looking for guidance and expertise in these areas, I'd love to connect and explore the opportunities. Let's build something great together!

## How Can I Help?

With 15+ years of experience in developer tools and automation projects, and wearing many hats like CNCF Ambassador, Jenkins maintainer or Testcontainers Champion, now I focus on community building, all kinds of project automation, developer relations and advocacy across multiple areas and technology stacks.

In my consulting work, I want to prioritize projects of social importance, like green tech, sustainability, efficient developer tools, or companies that #StandWithUkraine. Pro-bono consulting for nonprofits and foundations is possible, too.

My consulting areas include but not limited to:

### Developer Productivity

- Automation, developer tools and CI/CD in Java, Golang, Kubernetes and .NET technology stacks.
  I’m experienced with cloud native projects, automotive and embedded systems.
  I prefer GitHub Actions, Jenkins or Dagger, but have experience with other systems too.
- Observability and Developer Productivity, especially in the areas of CI/CD and build tools.  I got some experience with OpenTelemetry, developer portals, and (too?) many cloud native tools
- Custom feature, integrations and fixes for the open source projects which I maintain or contribute to: Jenkins, Jenkinsfile Runner, Testcontainers, OpenFeature, WireMock, Microcks, WinSW, and many others.

### DevRel Consulting

- Developer Relations and Developer Advocacy for your products and open source projects.
- Building and growing open source communities and ecosystems
- Technical documentation at scale, docs engines and customization for them, especially AsciiDocs, MkDocs, Hugo or Jekyll
- Community analytics, including GrimoireLab, LFX Insights or Common Room
- DevOps and InnerSource transformation
- Starting Open Source Programs and OSPOs

## My Availability

At the moment, I am looking for part-time consulting projects, up to several hours per week.
I can also take on short intense projects during my in lieu time-offs.

## Pro Bono Consulting

If you are from an open source community or a non-profit organization and looking for help or advice,
feel free to reach out!
My time is limited, but I will see whether I can help.
Company and client non-competition agreements may apply.
