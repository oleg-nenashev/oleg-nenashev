Here are the talks I submit to conferences and hence

## More Talks

Not all sessions are available on Sessionize.
I have already stopped giving most of Jenkins talks though I can refresh some upon request.
I often give specialized talks for different technology stacks
(e.g. Java/JVM, Golang, Cloud Native, Embedded, C++ or .NET)
for my clients and at local meetups,
and do not normally submit them to bigger events.
But you can see these talks and references in
[this Google Doc](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1ivtWiedTZeLP3ct1im7NAcnXPdFLrsBeuF5Gx0w3Byc/edit?usp=sharing).
