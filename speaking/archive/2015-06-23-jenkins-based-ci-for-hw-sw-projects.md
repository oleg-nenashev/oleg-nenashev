This talk addresses Jenkins-based continuous integration (CI) in the area of embedded systems, 
which include both hardware and software components. 
It provides an overview of common automation cases, challenges and their solutions based on Jenkins CI services. 
The specifics of Jenkins usage in the hardware area 
(available plugins and workarounds, environment and desired high availability features) is also covered.
