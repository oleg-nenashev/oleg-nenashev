At [ORCONF 2016](https://orconf.org/2017/) we announced the work on [LibreCores CI](https://www.librecores.org/static/librecores-ci) - 
a continuous integration service for open-source Hardware projects. 
During the last year we made some progress on this front, 
and this presentation reflects the current progress on infrastructure and development tools. 

This talk has been conducted together with [Stefan Wallentowitz](https://github.com/wallento)
who is one of LibreCores contributors.
