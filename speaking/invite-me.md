# Invite me as a speaker

I am available for speaking about open source projects and community building at in-person and online events.
I am not a traveling speaker and do it for free when possible,
especially for community events and local meetups.

My topics include whatever open source developer tools CI/CD and observability,
Jenkins, Testcontainers, WireMock, Java and developer tools, open hardware and open source community management.
I am a CNCF/CDF ambassador and a Testcontainers champion.
Send me a message if you are interested!
