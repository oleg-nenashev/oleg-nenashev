# Oleg Nenashev. Public C.V.

The C.V. below is focused on the Developer Productivity Engineer,
Open Source Community builder and DevRel consultant roles.
If you want to get information slices for other roles,
I can provide them on-demand.

Nowadays it is available as public and sometimes live Google Doc.
