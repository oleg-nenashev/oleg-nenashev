## My current availability

I am **NOT** actively looking for a job, bad luck if you are a company recruiter!
At the same time, I am ready to discuss good opportunities within the area of my interests.

If you are from an open source community and looking for help or advice, feel free to reach out!
My time might be limited, but I will see whether I could help.
Company non competition agreements may apply.
For Jenkins related topics please use the
[public community channels](https://www.jenkins.io/participate/connect/) when possible.

## My interests

My main interests: Research, Developer Tooling, Continuous Integration and Delivery, Embedded Systems, and Digital Hardware.
I am opinionated about climate change and interested in projects targeting this problem directly or via [sustainable development](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sustainable_development).
I used to be a hardcore introvert engineer in the past.
In 2021 I realized that I am more interested in working directly with end users and contributors, and helping them by facilitating changes and unblocking contributions.

Whether I work on private source or open source,
Open source is [in my blood](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ojx8dyes__8)!
I enjoyed joining the open source communities and helping them to grow.
I am interested in maintaining projects and communities.
These days I would rather look for developer advocate, 
OSPO program management, product management, community leadership,
or other community or Developer Relations roles. 
I would also consider open source and hybrid engineering positions.

It is also interesting to help enterprises to go through transformation by adopting DevOps and [InnerSource](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inner_source).
Hence I would be interested in joining
research divisions,
Open Source Program Office (OSPO), 
Inner Source Program Office (ISPO), 
or a CTO office.

## Only FOSS? Only Jenkins? Not at all!

I am not an open source zealot,
I can work on proprietary and open core/ecosystem projects.
I am also not a Jenkins zealot, tools are just tools for me.
I really love Jenkins for its extensibility and flexibility,
but I know it comes at cost of UX and maintenability if you are not the expert.
Closing the gap in the community :)
I've used and ready to use many other CI/CD systems in my projects.


At the same time I expect to keep contributing to the Jenkins community, the Continuous Delivery Foundation, and to Open Hardware space.
Discussing boundaries is on my checklist for any serious opportunity discussion.
