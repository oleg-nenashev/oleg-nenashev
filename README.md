**Jenkins** is first open source community I joined.
No regrets!
In [Jenkins](http://jenkins.io/) I am a community bulder, core maintainer, board member, and holder of other roles. 
I am not a mother of dragons, but I am definitely a father of many bugs ðŸ˜Š
My goal is to make the Jenkins community the best place to participate,
and to ensure long term evolution of the project and its community.

**CDF**. 
I have been a community ambassador in the [Continuous Delivery Foundation](https://cd.foundation/) since its inception.
In 2021 I was also elected to join the Technical Oversight Committee.
There I facilitate technical programs among member projects (including Jenkins or Tekton),
and joint projects with the CDF end users and members.

**Open Hardware**.
I am a big open hardware enthusiast,
with some experience in RISC-V and OpenRISC ecosystems.
I am a member of the [Free and Open Source Silicon (FOSSi) Foundation](https://www.fossi-foundation.org/)
and a contributor to the [LibreCores](https://www.librecores.org/) project.
I also have a PhD in hardware design.

**Pet Projects**.
I am a co-maintainer of [Windows Service Wrapper (WinSW)](https://github.com/winsw/winsw), not so active these days :( 
In June 2021 I've also started the [FaaScinator project](https://github.com/oleg-nenashev/FaaScinator) - 
a tool that converts Java CLI apps to FaaS containers and OpenFaaS templates, powered by Quarkus.
