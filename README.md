**Hello, world!** ðŸ‘‹
I am an open source contributor, advocate, and community builder at [WireMock Inc](https://www.wiremock.io/).
I work on WireMock and Jenkins open-source projects, and also help with advocacy for WireMock Cloud.
Alumni of Dynatrace, CloudBees, SPbSPU, Synopsys and Intel Labs.
**TL;DR:** Hardware engineer turned CI/CD systems admin turned developer tools engineer turned open source community leader.

## My communities and projects

**Jenkins** is the first open source community I joined.
No regrets, it has been a great experience!
In [Jenkins](http://jenkins.io/) I am a community builder, core maintainer, board member, event officer, and holder of many roles. 
I am not a mother of dragons, but I am definitely a father of bugs ðŸ˜Š
My goal is to make the Jenkins community the best place to participate,
and to ensure long term evolution of the project and its community.
Always [looking for contributors](https://www.jenkins.io/participate), code or not!

**WireMock.** I joined it in 2023 to help with growing user and developer communities.
It is a flexible open source tool for building mock APIs and testing your client apps, started as a Java testing library.

**Testcontainers.** I've been using Testcontainers since 2018, and in 2023 started actively contributing to the project.
I'm a creator and maintainer of [Testcontainers for C/C++](https://github.com/testcontainers/testcontainers-c) and a contributor to other implementations and modules.

**Continuous Delivery Foundation**.
I have been a community ambassador at the [CDF](https://cd.foundation/) since its inception.
In 2021 I was also elected to join the Technical Oversight Committee.
There I facilitate technical programs among member projects (including Jenkins or Tekton),
and joint projects with the CDF end users and members.

**Open Hardware**.
I am an open hardware enthusiast, with some experience in RISC-V and OpenRISC ecosystems.
I believe it will eat the world too ðŸš€
I volunteer in the [Free and Open Source Silicon (FOSSi) Foundation](https://www.fossi-foundation.org/)
and a contributor to the [LibreCores](https://www.librecores.org/) project.
I also have a PhD degree in hardware design and electronics design automation.

**Pet Projects**.
I am a co-maintainer of [Windows Service Wrapper (WinSW)](https://github.com/winsw/winsw), not so active these days ðŸ˜¢
In June 2021 I've also started the [FaaScinator project](https://github.com/oleg-nenashev/FaaScinator) - 
a tool that converts Java CLI apps to FaaS containers and OpenFaaS templates, powered by Quarkus.
