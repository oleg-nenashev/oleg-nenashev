In this presentation you can find introduction to Jenkins security and overview of best practices 
of administering Jenkins instances at scale. 


There is also a short overview of the [Ownership-based Security engine](https://github.com/jenkinsci/ownership-plugin/blob/master/doc/OwnershipBasedSecurity.md)
which has been developed by me in order to manage Jenkins instances with hundreds of active users.
