Welcome to the Dark side of Jenkins...

Almost all agent types in Jenkins use the Remoting library to communicate with the master, 
including JNLP and SSH agents. 
Although Jenkinsâ€™ ability to run tasks on multiple hosts is one of its success factors, 
agent connection stability is known to be a major pain point in large-scale installations. 
In this workshop, The talk is about remoting internals, how to diagnose issues, 
how to configure Jenkins and underlying infrastructure, and the future of this layer in Jenkins.
