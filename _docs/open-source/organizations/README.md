# My open source organization and foundations

## CNCF

The [Cloud Native Computing Foundation (CNCF)](https://www.cncf.io/) 
is the open source, vendor-neutral hub of cloud native computing,
hosting projects like Kubernetes and Prometheus to make cloud native universal and sustainable.
Oleg participates there, especially in the areas of open observability and Cloud Native CI/CD.

My public roles:

- CNCF Ambassador
- Technical Oversight Committee contributor
- _Kubecon + CloudNativeCon_ program committee member

## Continuous Delivery Foundation

[The Continuous Delivery Foundation (CDF)](https://cd.foundation/) 
is an open-source community improving the world's ability to deliver software with security and speed.
It includes 10+ projects, including Jenkins or Tekton, and facilitates growth and interoperability of the open source ecosystem.

I have been a community ambassador at the CDF since the inception of the program.
In 2021 I was also elected to join the Technical Oversight Committee.
There I facilitate technical programs among member projects (including Jenkins or Tekton),
and joint projects with the CDF end users and members.

## FOSSi

The [Free and Open Source Silicon Foundation (FOSSi)](https://fossi-foundation.org ) exists to promote and protect the open source silicon chip movement.
It actively encourages the communityâ€™s growth and is helping to maintain the open spirit of the movement, through events, educational programmes and working groups.

I am an open hardware enthusiast, with some experience in RISC-V and OpenRISC ecosystems.
I believe it will eat the world too ðŸš€
I volunteer in the [Free and Open Source Silicon (FOSSi) Foundation](https://www.fossi-foundation.org/)
and a contributor to the [LibreCores](https://www.librecores.org/) project.
I also have a PhD degree in hardware design and electronics design automation.

## API Neuchatel

The [Association of IT Professionals (API)](https://api-ne.ch/ )
supports the IT sector in the canton of NeuchÃ¢tel and beyond.
It organizes meetups and workshops in the region,
and also promotes the local tech news.

Olegâ€™s role: Co-organizer since 2022

## Jenkins RU

I am trying to consolidate the Russian-speaking community by setting up chats,
helping to users/developers and organizing Jenkins Area Meetups
in St. Petersburg, Moscow, Minsk and other cities.
30 meetups in 2015-2020, but now the effort is stopped due to the ongoing war in Ukraine.
There are plans to restart it as online community.
