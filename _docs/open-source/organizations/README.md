# My open source organization and foundations

## Continuous Delivery Foundation

I have been a community ambassador at the [CDF](https://cd.foundation/) since its inception.
In 2021 I was also elected to join the Technical Oversight Committee.
There I facilitate technical programs among member projects (including Jenkins or Tekton),
and joint projects with the CDF end users and members.

## Open Hardware

I am an open hardware enthusiast, with some experience in RISC-V and OpenRISC ecosystems.
I believe it will eat the world too ðŸš€
I volunteer in the [Free and Open Source Silicon (FOSSi) Foundation](https://www.fossi-foundation.org/)
and a contributor to the [LibreCores](https://www.librecores.org/) project.
I also have a PhD degree in hardware design and electronics design automation.

## Jenkins RU

I am trying to consolidate the Russian-speaking community by setting up chats,
helping to users/developers and organizing Jenkins Area Meetups
in St. Petersburg, Moscow, Minsk and other cities.
30 meetups in 2015-2020, but now the effort is stopped due to the ongoing war in Ukraine.
There are plans to restart it as online community.
