## My Availability

I am ready to discuss consulting opportunities within the area of my interests:
open source community management,
developer relations (DevRel),
developer tools and productivity,
CI/CD,
observability,
embedded or cloud native systems,
and sustainability.

It is also interesting to help enterprises to transform by
starting DevRel programs,
switching from classic marketing to product-led growth strategies,
or adopting [InnerSource](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inner_source).
Hence I would be interested in joining
research divisions, OSPOs, or CTO offices as an advisor.

## Pro Bono Consulting

If you are from an open source community and looking for help or advice, feel free to reach out!
Let's grab a [virtual coffee](https://calendly.com/onenashev/virtual-coffee).
My time might be limited, but I will see whether I can help.
Company non competition agreements may apply.
For Jenkins related topics please use the
[public community channels](https://www.jenkins.io/participate/connect/) when possible.
