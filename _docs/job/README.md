## My availability

I am ready to discuss consulting opportunities within the area of my interests:
sustainability, open research, CI/CD and cloud native systems.

If you are from an open source community and looking for help or advice, feel free to reach out!
Let's grab a [virtual coffee](https://calendly.com/onenashev/virtual-coffee).
My time might be limited, but I will see whether I can help.
Company non competition agreements may apply.
For Jenkins related topics please use the
[public community channels](https://www.jenkins.io/participate/connect/) when possible.

## My interests

My main interests: Open Source Communities, Developer Relations, Developer Tooling, Observability, Continuous Integration and Delivery, Embedded Systems, and Digital Hardware.
I am opinionated about climate change and interested in projects targeting this problem directly or via [sustainable development](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sustainable_development).
I used to be rather a classic introvert engineer in the past.
In 2018 I realized that I am more interested in working directly with end users and contributors, and helping them by facilitating changes and unblocking contributions.
So, welcome to community, product and project management career.

Whether I work on private source or open source,
Open source is [in my blood](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ojx8dyes__8)!
I enjoyed joining the open source communities and helping them to grow.
I am interested in maintaining projects and communities.
These days I would rather look for developer advocate, 
OSPO program management, product management, community leadership,
or other community or Developer Relations roles. 
I would also consider open source and hybrid engineering positions.

It is also interesting to help enterprises to go through transformation by adopting DevOps and [InnerSource](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inner_source).
Hence I would be interested in joining
research divisions,
Open Source Program Office (OSPO), 
Inner Source Program Office (ISPO), 
or a CTO office.

## Only FOSS? Only Jenkins? Not at all!

I am not an open source zealot, I can work on proprietary and open core/ecosystem projects.
I am also not a Jenkins zealot, tools are just tools for me.
I really love Jenkins for its extensibility and flexibility, but I know it comes at the cost of UX and maintainability if you are not an expert.
Closing the gap in the community :) I've used and am ready to use many other CI/CD systems in my projects.

At the same time I expect to keep contributing to the Jenkins community, the Continuous Delivery Foundation, and to Open Hardware space.
Discussing boundaries is on my checklist for any serious opportunity discussion.
