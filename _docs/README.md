# Hello, world! ðŸ‘‹

I am a community builder, open source contributor and advocate.
I work on Jenkins, WireMock and Testcontainers open-source projects, and also do open source consulting.
Alumni of CloudBees, SPbSPU, SynopsysDynatrace, and Intel Labs.
**TL;DR:** Hardware engineer turned CI/CD systems admin turned developer tools engineer turned open source community leader.
