# Hello, world! ðŸ‘‹

I am a community builder, open source contributor and advocate.
I work on Gradle, Jenkins, WireMock and Testcontainers open-source projects, and also do open source consulting.
Alumni of CloudBees, SPbSPU, Synopsys, WireMock, Dynatrace, and Intel Labs.
**TL;DR:** Hardware engineer turned CI/CD systems admin turned developer tools engineer turned open source community leader.

I am Russian, and I stand with Ukraine in the outgoing war.
I contribute to the military and humanitarian support for Ukraine,
and also participate in the Russian anti-war organizations.

## My interests

I used to be rather a classic introvert engineer in the past.
In 2018 I realized that I am more interested in working directly with end users and contributors, and helping them by facilitating changes and unblocking contributions.
So, welcome to community, product and project management career.
Whether I work on private or open source projects,
I follow the collaborative approach and try to build and grow communities
around the area of my work.
And yes, I am a big supporter of [InnerSource](https://innersourcecommons.org/).
